<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to the help.  Here you'll learn about how this cms works and the theories that drive it.  You will want to note, this is not a CMS or DMS, it's an AMS.</p>

<h3>Amorphic theory</h3>
<p>An Amorphic Management System (AMS) app is one that can change to match any CMS / DMS / eCommerce / etc application.  The goal of this AMS is to put forth a solution for the one to rule them all view.  The structure of the application objects are defined by a set of questions in order to form it's self.  These questions are designed to let a person create anything you can think of that can be represented on a computer.  This means that you could structure a set of objects that form a blog or a set of objects that acts as a file system.  With this approach the goal is that a person may be able to provide a all in one solution for the largest of deployments.   Although it is possible to design the site so that it covers everything under the sun, remember that the user can only see so much information before becoming overwhelmed.  With that in mind it is suggested that you do micro deployments of an area of interest.  This means that you, for example create one site that is a script service site, another that only handles url shortening and redirects, and then maybe a blog for each department.  You may use the oAthu to connect the installs so that it still acts as one, but like the human body, cells moving in unison reflecting the whole's wishes.</p>

<h3>Few ideas</h3>
<p>There are a few key ideas that will help define how things need to form and act.  </p>
<ol>
	<li>Everything that is posted is stored as a posting</li>
	<li>The base post type is a page.</li>
	<li>Page, layout, post template, menu are reserved core</li>
	<li>All postings are to a site</li>
	<li>A site has options</li>
	<li>Postings have meta data</li>
	<li>Postings may have feilds</li>
	<li>Users are split in to groups of frontend / admin</li>
	<li>Both admin and Frontend have theme support</li>
	<li>All changes to posts with false checksum is versioned</li>
	<li>All posts have a version and a revision of the version</li>
	<li>Point version resleases aree the working/backup copies <br/>
			IE: "foo" version 3 rev 4 is the working copy over "foo" version 3 rev 1 nad from "foo" version 3 rev 0</li>
	<li>The largest version int release is the Published IE: "foo" version 3 is showen over "foo" version 2</li>
	<li>Rendering is a bubbled process where we start with the base post type and work out wards</li>
</ol>
